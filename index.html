            <p>Breakfast is the first meal of the day. It literally means to ‘break’ the ‘fast’ (i.e. the period without eating) of the night time.
               Breakfast, strictly speaking, happens early in the morning. But, some people eat breakfast foods at other times of the day.
               Healthy breakfast is extremely important to maintain healthy body and mind. It is a way of caring for ourselves and those we share breakfast with. Good energy stops us being distracted by hunger pangs.

               A healthy breakfast provides us with vitamins and minerals to strengthen our immune system. Yogurt, soy milk and kale smoothies give us a calcium boost. Fiber gives us good digestive health for the rest of the day. Slow burn energy from oats, whole grain cereal or bananas keep us going throughout the day.

               Healthy food is very tasty to eat. Eating healthily at breakfast stops us eating unhealthy snacks later on. Cooking healthy food is such a creative thing to do.

               Thus, there are so many reasons to start the day with a healthy breakfast.

            <p>The key to a nutritious packed lunch is variety and getting the right balance of foods to provide you with the nutrients you need to stay healthy.

                Our daily intake of calories and nutrients is split over the meals and snacks we eat throughout the day. One way to spread calorie intake over the day is to consume 20% of total calorie intake at breakfast, 30% at lunch, 30% at dinner and 20% for snacks. The calories we consume from drinks is also included in this allowance.
                
                Table 1 shows what the breakdown of calories looks like over a say for men and women. Most calories should come from food eaten at meals times rather than from drinks and snacks.
                A healthy, sustaining lunch should be based around wholegrain breads such as wraps, pitta pockets, rye crispbread, wholegrain pasta, rice or noodles.

                Try to include some lean protein to help keep you full such as salmon or tuna, eggs, pulses, prawns or chicken. If you include these foods in a packed lunch it will need to be refrigerated to minimise the risk of food poisoning.

                It is important to include plenty of fruit and vegetables in your lunch, e.g. an apple, satsuma, handful of cherry tomatoes, carrot, cucumber, pepper or celery sticks, small tub of fruit salad or small box of raisins.

                Include a drink with your lunch. Water is fine but you can also include milk or milk alternative like Oat Drink if you are lactose intolerant.

            <p>They stimulate digestion by acting as a prebiotic and contain anti-inflammatory compounds. Combine them with plenty of spices like ginger to warm you up this winter. If you do have challenges with sleep keep garlic lower at dinner as it can stimulate an active mind and restless sleep.
                Dinner is an important meal, but you can experiment with a range of great foods. Having a healthy dinner is linked to good sleep, good choices at breakfast and lunch, lower inflammation, greater resilience to stress, better digestion, stable blood sugar and lower anxiety.</p>
